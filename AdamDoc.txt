Run the following:

wget https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.71.0/source/boost_1_71_0.tar.gz 
tar xvzf boost_1_71_0.tar.gz
cd boost_1_71_0/
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh
./b2

This will output something like:

```
The Boost C++ Libraries were successfully built!

The following directory should be added to compiler include paths:

    /home/glicka/boost_1_71_0

The following directory should be added to linker library paths:

    /home/glicka/boost_1_71_0/stage/lib
```

Remove lines 31-34 to `install_g4py.sh` and the following:

set(BOOST_ROOT "$/home/glicka/boost_1_71_0")
set(BOOST_INCLUDE_DIRS "${BOOST_ROOT}/include")
set(BOOST_LIBRARY_DIRS "${BOOST_ROOT}/stage/lib/")
set(ENV{BOOST_INCLUDEDIR} "${BOOST_ROOT}/include")
set(ENV{BOOST_LIBRARYDIR} "${BOOST_ROOT}/lib")

I don't think that the last two lines of this are necessary, but I had them included just in case.

Then run:
export PYTHONPATH=~/GEANT4.10.5.p0/geant4-source/environments/g4py/lib:~/GEANT4.10.5.p0/geant4-source/environments/g4py/lib/examples:~/GEANT4.10.5.p0/geant4-source/environments/g4py/lib/tests

setenv PYTHONPATH
```
bash installs/install_g4py.sh
```

which will run until the last two lines.

If it fails because it cannot find the package XercesC, run the following:

`sudo apt-get install libxerces-c-dev`

To link the new installation to system python do the following:

```
cd /usr/lib/python2.7/
sudo mkdir Geant4
sudo ln -sf "/home/glicka/GEANT4.10.5.p0/geant4-source/environments/g4py27/lib/Geant4" "/usr/lib/python2.7/Geant4"
```

Finally you can install the `geant4py` package to run the examples. cd to wherever you cloned the folder and run:

```
sudo python setup.py install
```

If you're going to add something to g4py, for example a new geometry to the `prebuilt` folder, you need to also add a line in the `__init__.py` file for that new geomtry. Otherwise it won't install and running a script with that geometry will not work.
